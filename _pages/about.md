I am a senior data scientist and the Section Supervisor for an information extraction (IE) section
at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, working at the intersection of artificial 
intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) and knowledge representation. My current research interests include 
trustworthy AI, the intersection of NLP, LLMs, and knowledge graphs, and healthcare analytics.
