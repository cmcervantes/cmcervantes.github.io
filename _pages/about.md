I am a senior data scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, 
working at the intersection of information extraction (IE) and knowledge representation.
My focus is in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for understanding 
semantics: extracting knowledge from text and integrating those extractions with 
knowledge graphs (KGs).

My research interests include entity extraction, relation and event extraction,
relevance ranking, knowledge graph embedding and completion, ontology learning, 
grounding, scene understanding, co-reference resolution, and healthcare analytics
(particularly related to pulmonary health).
